**Jazon - World’s First Downloadable AI SDR**

Jazon is built on Lyzr Automata, a multi-agent automation framework that allows anyone to build reliable enterprise-grade meta-agents. Jazon performs all functions of an SDR. You can build any meta-agent similar to Jazon using the Lyzr Automata framework.

**Why did we build Jazon?**

It all started with a tweet from Jason Lemkin of SaaStr. We took this as a challenge to build a meta-agent on Lyzr Automata. We ended up building a base version in just four days.

Below is the architecture we designed to solve the above problem statement from Jason Lemkin.

And here is how Jazon works with a placeholder UI built by our team.
